For example, an interface could automatically display any tokens that are on at least m out of n reputable lists. Or it could display all tokens across a set of lists, but display trust scores based on the number lists an asset is on. Or it can build in a list explorer that allows any user to import the lists that they want to trust.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another critical advantage of lists is the speed at which new assets can be discovered and used. If a new asset is released by a reputable project, the project can simply update their own list and any interface (or aggregate list maintainer) subscribed to that list can automatically import it in real time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To help spur adoption of Token Lists and provide a high quality reference example, we have deprecated the old Kwikswap interface “default list”, and replaced it with a list explorer and importing mechanism. `}</p>\n    <p>{`We have also partnered with a number of reputable projects in the space who were excited to create and maintain lists of their own.
