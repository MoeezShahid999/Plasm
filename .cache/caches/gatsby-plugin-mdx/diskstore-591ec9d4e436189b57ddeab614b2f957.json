However, it is often the case that a trusted price observation cannot be obtained (e.g. in multi-step, programmatic interactions involving Kwikswap). Without a price oracle, these interactions are forced to trade at whatever the (potentially manipulated) rate on Kwikswap is. However, an oracle can bound manipulation, and is a sine qua non. Determining the ideal oracle for a given setting is out of scope, but for details on the Kwikswap approach to oracles, see `}<Link to='/docs/v1/core-concepts/oracles' mdxType=\"Link\">{`Oracles`}</Link>{`.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
