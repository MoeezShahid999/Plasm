The formula really is very simple. If we neglect trading fees, we have the following:`}</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`eth_liquidity_pool * token_liquidity_pool = constant_product`}</inlineCode></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>{`In other words, the number of tokens a trader receives for their ETH and vice versa is calculated such that after the trade, the product of the two liquidity pools is the same as it was before the trade. The consequence of this formula is that for trades which are very small in value compared to the size of the liquidity pool we have:`}</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`eth_price = token_liquidity_pool / eth_liquidity_pool`}</inlineCode></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>{`Combining these two equations, we can work out the size of each liquidity pool at any given price, assuming constant total liquidity:`}</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`eth_liquidity_pool = sqrt(constant_product / eth_price)`}</inlineCode></li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`token_liquidity_pool = sqrt(constant_product * eth_price)`}</inlineCode></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>{`So let’s look at the impact of a price change on a liquidity provider. To keep things simple, let’s imagine our liquidity provider supplies 1 ETH and 100 DAI to the Kwikswap DAI exchange, giving them 1% of a liquidity pool which contains 100 ETH and 10,000 DAI. This implies a price of 1 ETH = 100 DAI. Still neglecting fees, let’s imagine that after some trading, the price has changed; 1 ETH is now worth 120 DAI. What is the new value of the liquidity provider’s stake? Plugging the numbers into the formulae above, we have:`}</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`eth_liquidity_pool = 91.2871`}</inlineCode></li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`dai_liquidity_pool = 10954.4511`}</inlineCode></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>{`“Since our liquidity provider has 1% of the liquidity tokens, this means they can now claim 0.9129 ETH and 109.54 DAI from the liquidity pool. But since DAI is approximately equivalent to USD, we might prefer to convert the entire amount into DAI to understand the overall impact of the price change. At the current price then, our liquidity is worth a total of 219.09 DAI. What if the liquidity provider had just held onto their original 1 ETH and 100 DAI? Well, now we can easily see that, at the new price, the total value would be 220 DAI. So our liquidity provider lost out by 0.91 DAI by providing liquidity to Kwikswap instead of just holding onto their initial ETH and DAI.”`}</p>\n      <p>{`“Of course, if the price were to return to the same value as when the liquidity provider added their liquidity, this loss would disappear. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`For this reason, we can call it an `}</strong>{`impermanent loss`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`.`}</strong>{` Using the equations above, we can derive a formula for the size of the impermanent loss in terms of the price ratio between when liquidity was supplied and now.
