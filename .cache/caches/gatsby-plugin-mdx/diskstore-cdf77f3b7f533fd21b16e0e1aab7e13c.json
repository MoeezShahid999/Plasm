Kwikswap is the most popular AMM on Ethereum. Like most AMMs, Kwikswap facilitates trading between a particular pair of assets by holding reserves of both assets. It sets the trading price between them based on the size of its reserves in such a way that prices will stay in line with the broader market. Anybody who would like to can join the “pool” for a particular pair and become a liquidity provider, or LP, so-called because they provide liquid assets for others to trade against.

A particularly useful primitive is the ability to measure the price of an asset, a problem often known as the pricing oracle problem. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of a very large class of automated market makers, called constant function market makers (or CFMMs) which includes existing popular market makers such as Kwikswap, Balancer, and Curve, whose yearly transaction volume totals to billions of dollars. We give sufficient conditions such that, under fairly general assumptions, agents who interact with these constant function market makers are incentivized to correctly report the price of an asset and that they can do so in a computationally efficient way. We also derive several other useful properties that were previously not known. These include lower bounds on the total value of assets held by CFMMs and lower bounds guaranteeing that no agent can, by any set of trades, drain the reserves of assets held by a given CFMM.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"liquidity-provider-returns-in-geometric-mean-markets\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}><a parentName=\"h1\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#liquidity-provider-returns-in-geometric-mean-markets\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"liquidity provider returns in geometric mean markets permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n      }}><svg parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n          \"focusable\": \"false\",\n          \"height\": \"16\",\n          \"version\": \"1.1\",\n          \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n          \"width\": \"16\"\n        }}><path parentName=\"svg\" {...{\n            \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n            \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n          }}></path></svg></a>{`Liquidity Provider Returns in Geometric Mean Markets`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Authors: Alex Evans`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Geometric mean market makers (G3Ms), such as Kwikswap and Balancer, comprise a popular class of automated market makers (AMMs) defined by the following rule: the reserves of the AMM before and after each trade must have the same (weighted) geometric mean. This paper extends several results known for constant-weight G3Ms to the general case of G3Ms with time-varying and potentially stochastic weights. These results include the returns and no-arbitrage prices of liquidity pool (LP) shares that investors receive for supplying liquidity to G3Ms. Using these expressions, we show how to create G3Ms whose LP shares replicate the payoffs of financial derivatives. The resulting hedges are model-independent and exact for derivative contracts whose payoff functions satisfy an elasticity constraint. These strategies allow LP shares to replicate various trading strategies and financial contracts, including standard options. G3Ms are thus shown to be capable of recreating a variety of active trading strategies through passive positions in LP shares.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"the-replicating-portfolio-of-a-constant-product-market\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}><a parentName=\"h1\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#the-replicating-portfolio-of-a-constant-product-market\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"the replicating portfolio of a constant product market permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n      }}><svg parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n          \"focusable\": \"false\",\n          \"height\": \"16\",\n          \"version\": \"1.1\",\n          \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n          \"width\": \"16\"\n        }}><path parentName=\"svg\" {...{\n            \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n            \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n          }}></path></svg></a>{`The Replicating Portfolio of a Constant Product Market`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Authors: Joseph Clark`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`We derive the replicating portfolio of a constant product market.
